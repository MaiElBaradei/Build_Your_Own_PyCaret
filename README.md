# Streamlit PyCaret ML Experiments

## Overview
This project provides a Streamlit application for simplifying the setup and execution of machine learning experiments using PyCaret. It streamlines the process of loading datasets, preprocessing data, setting up experiments, optimizing models, and saving the best model for future use.

## Features
- **Dataset Upload**: Users can upload datasets in CSV, Excel, or JSON format.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Provides options for handling missing values, changing data types, and selecting features.
- **Experiment Setup**: Allows users to set up classification or regression experiments with custom configurations.
- **Model Optimization**: Enables users to compare models, tune hyperparameters, blend models, and stack models for optimal performance.
- **Model Saving**: Provides functionality to save the best-performing model for future use.

## Usage
1. Upload your dataset.
2. Select data preprocessing options.
3. Set up your machine learning experiment (classification or regression).
4. Optimize models using various metrics.
5. Save the best model for deployment or further analysis.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- PyCaret
